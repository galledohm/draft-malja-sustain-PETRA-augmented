1.  Introduction

   Sustainability is becoming one of the major societal goals for the
   next decade, and networks are one of the major consumers of energy
   nowadays.  Sustainability of network services is thus one of the
   forefronts of innovation and action from network service
   stakeholders, involving manufacturers, operators and customers.  In
   this line, there is a shared goal of achieving better energy
   awareness.

   As with any other network metric, the energy traffic ratio could be
   collected from the underlying network infrastructure.  However, there
   is not a common or single definition of energy metrics towards
   network consumers so that can be uniformly reported, particularly in
   heterogeneous network scenarios.  This document introduces an API to
   query networks about Energy Traffic Ratio.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
